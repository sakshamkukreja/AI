Create a hosting place and past all files over there.

### Now how to open the website:
  Suppose we have hosted this on local server and on port number 80. 
  
  Then to access website we can simply write url `localhost:80/` or `localhost:80/index.html` or simply `localhost`
  
  The default page will open and that is for realtime. The camera gets automatically started or a prompt message will come to allow access of camera.
  
  After that all features will start.
  
  Now if we would like to play a file then click on `From file` button.
  
  Now from here we have to click on `Select File` button and choose a mp4 file.
  
  Once we open that mp4 file, all features will start.
  
  We have few features on left side like `Affect` and `Emition`.
  
  By clicking on that the coreesponding graph will applied on top of video.
  
  To remove those features we have to click on `Affect` or `Emition` again.
